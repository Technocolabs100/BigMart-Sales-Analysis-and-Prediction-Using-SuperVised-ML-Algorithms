    "3. **MRP Influence on Sales Across Item Types:**\n",
    "   - **Hypothesis:** The impact of Maximum Retail Price (MRP) on sales varies across different item types.\n",

    "4. **Effect of Outlet Size on Sales for Different Item Types:**\n",
    "   - **Hypothesis:** The relationship between outlet size and total sales is influenced by the type of items sold.\n",
    "   - **Reasoning:** The report mentions that medium-sized outlets have the highest total sales. We could hypothesize that the influence of outlet size on sales is not uniform across all types of items and that certain item categories may perform better in specific outlet sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Geographical Location and Sales Patterns:**\n",
    "   - **Hypothesis:** Sales patterns vary across different geographical locations (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3).\n",
    "   - **Reasoning:** The report indicates that Tier 3 locations have the highest total sales. However, it does not explore the reasons behind these geographical variations. We could hypothesize that customer preferences, demographics, or other factors contribute to different sales patterns in various locations.\n",
